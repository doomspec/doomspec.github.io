Hi, I am Zi-Jian Zhang. Here is my blog. I am a student who studies quantum computing in Man-Hong Yung's group at Southern university of Science and Technology (Shenzhen, China). I am interested in near-term quantum algorithms and therefore study the fields where quantum computing is likely to have industrial application on in near-term, including

1. Variational quantum algorithm for chemistry
2. Adaptive quantum algorithm

I am also interested in quantum programming platform. I am the main author of *Mizore*, which is a framework for adaptive quantum algorithms. We will publish it soon.

More research experience is in my [CV](CV_ZijianZhang.pdf) and [Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O2S4JLkAAAAJ&hl=en).

Though this blog mainly publish Chinese article, you can view the English articles [here](http://zijian-zhang.com/archive/?tag=English).

Personally, I am interested in: 

1. Japanese language, anime, literature and music (Vocaloid). 
2. Post-modernism and cultural anthropology. Epistemology and ethics. 
3. Network science, computational sociology and bioinformatics.
